                            You already know JavaScript, and are looking to design an architecture?

                            Learn how to craft a workflow that increases your development productivity and reduces issues during deployments. Automate your workflow using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "Grunt: JavaScript Task Runner"), and _master_ **Continuous Development, Integration, and Deployment**.

                            Design applications thoughtfully. Distribute your application and **implement a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer "REST Architecture") API**. Write _cleaner, testable_ code.

                h1 Designing Javascript Applications
                h2 A Build First Approach

            :markdown
                Large JavaScript applications are becoming increasingly widespread, and a more structured approach to application building is in order. The **Build First** philosophy helps us cover the need for a _reasonably scalable_ application design process.

                Throughout the book you'll find information about designing a _build process_, allowing you to **minimize manual labor**, while keeping productivity in check. You'll also pick up techniques to run tasks whenever your code changes, deploy your application typing _just a couple of words in your terminal_, and monitor the state of your application once it's live in production.

                As you read on, you'll pick up ways to improve your development process, enabling you to design and develop well-rounded application architectures for both the browser and the Node.JS platform. You'll find examples along the way to guide you through the thought process, as well as an entire section of the book, which is dedicated to validate the Build First concepts by example.
